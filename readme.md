# xsampa

Transforms strings from [X-Sampa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) to [IPA (international phonetic alphabet)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).

X-Sampa is an ASCII representation of the IPA. It was conceived as a way to convey phonetic or phonemic transcriptions when UTF-8 was not really a thing in the web. Nowadays it can still be useful as a way to type IPA without the keyboard being configured with the whole IPA.
